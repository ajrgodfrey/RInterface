# Purpose and objectives

This repo was started in July 2023.

The purpose is to develop an HTML-based R interface that can be used through a browser on a local machine. 


Success for this exercise will look like:

1. An interface that works well with screen readers. (achieved, but more development is possible)
2. A back end that links with R so that commands are issued in a live session, and output is captured and displayed in the HTML.


Nice-to-have outcomes include:

3. the interface is cosmetically appealing to a sighted person.
4. the colour schemes for the interface suit a range of low-vision users.
